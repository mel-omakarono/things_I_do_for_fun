# Kanji Lookup

This code is used to simplify my kanji lookup process. 

I have been studying Japanese for a few years and have found it tedious to look up every single kanji that I don't know how to read. Therefore, this code accesses jisho.org directly and tokenizes my text to find the reading and meanings of the kanji in the given text.
